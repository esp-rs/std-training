# Preparations

This chapter contains informations about the course material, the required hardware and an installation guide.

## Icons and Formatting we use

We use Icons to mark different kinds of information in the book:
* ✅ Call for action
* ❗️ Warnings, Details that require special attention
* 🔎 Knowledge that dives deeper into a subject, but which you are not required to understand to proceed.
* 💬 Descriptions for Accessibility

> Example note: Notes like this one contain helpful information
