## I2C Sensor Reading Exercise

TODO `i2c-sensor-reading/exercise/src/main.rs` is an exercise skeleton that will build. The task is to use an existing driver from crates.io to read out the temperature and humidity sensor over i2c. After that, a second sensor will be read out over the same i2c bus using `shared-bus`. The driver for the second sensor is available locally in `common/`.

`i2c-sensor-reading/solution/src/main.rs` contains a working solution.


* Define two pins, one as SDA and one as SCL. Use them to instantiate an Instance of the I²C peripheral. 

* Using the existing driver crates, make an instance of each sensor, passing the I²C instance into them. 


TODO `i2c-driver/exercise/src/main.rs` contains working code. Running it without modifying the driver file will yield errors. 

`i2c-driver/solution/src/imc42670p.rs` provides a solution to the task.
