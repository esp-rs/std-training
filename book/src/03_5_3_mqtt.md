# MQTT Exercise: Receiving LED Commands

✅ Subscribe to `color_topic(uuid)`

✅ Verify your subscription is working by logging the received topic and running the `example_client` in parallel in it's own terminal. The example_client is subscribed to the `ColorData.topic` and sends a board LED `color` roughly every second.

✅ React to the LED commands by setting the newly received color to the board with `led.set_pixel(/* received color here */)`.

### Encoding and decoding message payloads

The board LED commands are made of three bytes indicating red, green and blue.
    - `enum ColorData` contains a topic `color_topic(uuid)` and the `BoardLed`
    - it can convert the `data()` field of an `EspMqttMessage` by using `try_from()`. The message needs first to be coerced into a slice, using `let message_data: &[u8] = &message.data();`
    

```rust
// RGB LED command

if let Ok(ColorData::BoardLed(color)) = ColorData::try_from(message_data) { /* set new color here */ }
```

## Publish & Subscribe

`EspMqttClient` is not only responsible for publishing but also for subscribing to topics.

```rust
let subscribe_topic = /* ... */;
client.subscribe(subscribe_topic, QoS::AtLeastOnce)
```

## Handling incoming messages


The `message_event` parameter in the handler closure is of type `Option<Result<Event<EspMqttMessage>>>`.
Since we're only interested in processing successfully received messages, we can make use of deep pattern matching into the closure:

```rust
let mut client =
        EspMqttClient::new_with_callback(broker_url, &mqtt_config, move |message_event| {
            if let Some(Ok(Received(message))) = message_event {
                /* process_message() function here */
            }
        })?;
```

In the processing function, you will handle `Complete` messages. Use Rust Analyzer to generate the missing match arms or match any other type of response by logging an `info!()`.
```rust
    match message.details() {
        // all messages in this exercise will be of type `Complete`
        // the other variants of the `Details` enum are for larger message payloads
        Complete(token) => {
            
            // Cow<&[u8]> can be coerced into a slice &[u8] or a Vec<u8>
            // You can coerce it into a slice to be sent to try_from()
            let message_data: &[u8] = &message.data();
            if let Ok(ColorData::BoardLed(color)) = ColorData::try_from(message_data) {
                // set the LED to the newly received color

            }
        }
        // Use Rust Analyzer to generate the missing match arms or match an incomplete message with a log message.
        
    }
```


## Hints

- Use a logger to see what you are receiving, for example: `info!("{}", color);` or `dbg!(color)`.

## Extra tasks

### Implement MQTT with hierarchical topics

- Implement the same procedure but by using MQTT hierarchy. Subscribe subscribing to all "command" messages, combining `cmd_topic_fragment(uuid)` with a trailing `#` wildcard.

- in the example client, you will need to change to replace `color` with `command`. For example, unquote this line `//let command = Command::BoardLed(color);` and quote the corresponding `let color = ColorData::BoardLed(color);`
`

- Use `enum Command` instead of `enum ColorData`. `enum Command` represents all possible commands (here: just `BoardLed`).

- `RawCommandData` stores the last part of a message topic (e.g. `board_led` in `a-uuid/command/board_led`). It can be converted into a `Command` using `try_from`.

```rust
// RGB LED command
let raw = RawCommandData {
    path: command,
    data: message.data(),
};

```
- in the `process_message()` function you will need to parse the topic.

```rust
match message.details() {
    Details::Complete(token) => {
        // all messages in this exercise will be of type `Complete`
        // the other variants of the `Details` enum
        // are for larger message payloads

        // Cow<str> behaves a lot like other Rust strings (&str, String)
        let topic: Cow<str> = message.topic(token); 

        // determine if we're interested in this topic and
        // dispatch based on its content
        let is_command_topic: bool = /* ... */;
        if is_command_topic {
            let raw = RawCommandData { /* ... */ };
            if let Ok(Command::BoardLed(color)) = Command::try_from(raw) {
                // set the LED to the newly received color
            }
        
        },
        _ => {}
        }
    }
}
```

#### Hints!

- Since you will be iterating over a MQTT topic, you will need to `split()` on a string returns an iterator. You can access a specific item from an iterator using [`nth()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.nth).
- The solution implementing hiearchy can be run with `cargo espflash --release --example solution2 --monitor /dev/ttyUSB0`, while the solution without can be run with `cargo espflash --release --monitor /dev/ttyUSB0` or `cargo espflash --release --example solution1 --monitor /dev/ttyUSB0`

### Other tasks

- leverage [`serde_json`](https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/) to encode/decode your message data as JSON.
- Send some messages with a large payload from the example client and process them on the microcontroller. Large messages will be delivered in parts instead of `Details::Complete`:

```rust
InitialChunk(chunk_info) => { /* first chunk */},
SubsequentChunk(chunk_data) => { /* all subsequent chunks */ }
```
You do not need to differentiate incoming chunks based on message ID, since at most one message will be in flight at any given time. 

## Troubleshooting

- `error: expected expression, found .` when building example client: update your stable Rust installation to 1.58 or newer
- MQTT messages not showing up? make sure all clients (board and workstation) use the same UUID (you can see it in the log output)
